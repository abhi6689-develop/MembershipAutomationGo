# Go TCP Server with Redis State Management

This repository consists of two main components: a Head and multiple Workers. Together, they form a resilient system for managing TCP connections and node states using Redis. The Head sends periodic messages, while Workers listen for these messages and respond to changes, including handling orphaned states.

## Project Structure

- **Head/**:
  - **main.go**: Entry point for the head node server.
  - **send_messages.go**: Handles sending periodic messages to worker nodes.
  - **go.mod**: Manages dependencies for the Head component.
  
- **Workers/**:
  - **main.go**: Entry point for worker nodes.
  - **communication.go**: Manages TCP communications.
  - **redis_actions.go**: Provides utility functions for interacting with Redis.
  - **globals.go**: Defines global variables and synchronization primitives.
  - **reassignment.go**: Contains logic triggered when a worker node becomes orphaned.
  - **watch_node.go**: Monitors the status of the head node.
  - **go.mod** and **go.sum**: Manage dependencies for the Workers component.

## Features

- **Robust Node Management**: Automatically detects and handles failures in head nodes, ensuring system reliability.
- **Redis Integration**: Uses Redis to monitor and update the state of each node, facilitating quick data synchronization across the network.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Supports scaling to multiple worker nodes, each capable of independently detecting and handling state changes.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.15 or later
- Redis server

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the necessary Go dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-tcp-redis-server.git
cd go-tcp-redis-server/Head
go mod tidy
cd ../Workers
go mod tidy
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the Redis server:
   ```bash
   redis-server
   ```

2. Run the head node:
   ```bash
   cd Head
   go run main.go
   ```

3. In a new terminal, run the worker node(s):
   ```bash
   cd Workers
   go run main.go
   ```

## Usage

Use this application to demonstrate robust TCP connection handling with automated failover in a distributed environment. Customize worker behavior by modifying `reassignment.go` for specific failover logic.
